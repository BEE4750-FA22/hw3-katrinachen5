# Problem 1

## Problem 1.1
There are multiple decision variables to consider.
One decision variable is the installed capacity in MW of generator type g. Let this be $x_g$.
Another decision variable is the production in MW from generator type g in period t. Let this be $y_{g,t}$.
A third decision variable is considering the non-served energy in MWh in each period t. Let this be $z_t$.

The problem consisted of 6 different generator types: geothermal, coal, CCGT, CT, wind, and solar. 
A period is 24 hours, counting by hours (ie $t=1$ means 1 hour). 

```julia
using JuMP
using HiGHS

energy_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)

generators = ["geothermal","coal","CCGT","CT","wind","solar"];
period = 1:24;

G = 1:length(generators);
T = 1:length(period);

@variable(energy_model,x[G]>=0);
@variable(energy_model,y[G,T]>=0);
@variable(energy_model,z[T]>=0);
```

## Problem 1.2
The objective of this problem is to minimize the total costs for capacity expansion.
The total cost includes investment cost, operating cost, and the cost of non-served energy. 

Let $C_g^{INV}$ be the investment cost for a generator g, $C_g^{OP}$ be the operating cost for a generator g, and $C_t^{NS}$ be the the non-served energy cost for time period t.
Also, let $L_t$ be the length of the time period t.
With these variables, we can model the cost as:

```math
minZ = \sum_g C_g^{INV} x_g + \sum_g \sum_t L_t C_g^{OP} y_{g,t} + \sum_t C_t^{NS} L_t z_t
```
```julia
@objective(energy_model, Min, [457000, 268000, 85000, 62580, 92000, 92000]' * x + sum(365*22*y[2,:] + 365*35*y[3,:] + 365*45*y[4,:]) + (365*1000*sum(z)))
```

## Problem 1.3
One constraint is that generators cannot produce more than their capacity factor. 
For example, for the wind generator at 1 hour,
```math
y_{wind,1} <= 0.58 * x_wind
```

Another constraint is that they need to serve enough energy to meet the demand. 
```math
demand = sum_{g} y_{g,t} + z_t 
```

Another constraint is that the variables cannot be negative.
```math
x_g >= 0
y_{g,t} >= 0
z_t >= 0
```


```julia
avail = zeros(length(G),length(T));

avail[1, :] .= thermal_cf[1];
avail[2, :] .= thermal_cf[2];
avail[3, :] .= thermal_cf[3];
avail[4, :] .= thermal_cf[4];
avail[5, :] = wind_cf;
avail[6, :] = solar_cf;

@constraint(energy_model,availability[g in G, t in T], y[g,t] <= avail[g,t]*x[g]);

@contraint(energy_model,load[t in T], sum(y[:, t]) == demand[t])
```

## Problem 1.4

optimize!(energy_model)
```
